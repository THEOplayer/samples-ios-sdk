# THEOplayer iOS Reference Apps - THEO Offline Playback

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate how [THEOplayer] can be used to download protected and unprotected content for offline playback.

For quick start, please proceed with the [Quick Start](#Quick-Start) guide and make sure to run the app on a real device because offline playback is not supported in simulators.

## Guides

The guides below will provide a detailed explanation about caching stream for offline playback using THEOplayer Cache API.

* [THEOplayer How To's - Offline Stream Caching]

This app is an extension of [THEO Basic Playback] application. Please checkout the following guides should any help is needed to get started with Xcode and/or THEOplayer SDK.

* [THEO Knowledge Base - Xcode Setup]
* [THEOplayer How To's - Setup Reference Application]
* [THEOplayer How To's - THEOplayer iOS SDK Integration]

## Quick Start

* Obtain THEOplayer iOS SDK. If you don't have a SDK yet, please visit [Get Started with THEOplayer].
* Extract the downloaded **`iOSSDK-[version]-[name].zip`**. For example:

      unzip iOSSDK-[version]-[name].zip

* Copy & paste the **`THEOplayerSDK.framework`** folder to the root of the reference app project. For example:

      cp -a THEOplayerSDK.framework/ Offline-Playback/

* Open the reference app project `Offline_Playback.xcodeproj` with Xcode.
* Select `Product > Run` from Xcode menu bar or press `⌘ + R` on the keyboard to build and run the application.
